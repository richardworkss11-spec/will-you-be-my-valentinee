 okay awesome, i switched to a new branch, now here's the thing. i havent' run the sql     
  file in supabase, i will befor that i wanna do something, see, i want that, people are    
  able to create their accound, like withing an instant. so we will use google account      
  creation, when people do that, after that they sign  they are able to setup their basic profile, name, and add their profile picture,

  afther doing that, they will be able to share their profil,e in which people will be able to do that, the current one we are doing, you knwo the curent screen, people are able go on that message, will yo be my valentine, page, after tehy click on that, they are taken to that form page, where they enter their nma,e details and photo.

  and then they are able to submit.

  now, the best part, we will create a public wall, so by that what i mean is, on public wall, so lets say i created myaccojutn and then shared my profile, where eole are able to submit that, so after each submittion, that goes on my public wall, and that shows, lets say someone wnent there, submitted, so their one is displayed on my public wall, 

  so for each people who submit, we want to give them option, for their image, if they want to make their picture when they submit to be displayed on public wall or to only to that people

  let me try to exlain you this, lets say i went and submitted form on someones elses' profile, then while being on that form page i should be able to choose if i want my photo to be dislayed that person's public wall, or only that person should be able to see that photo.

  bro now please think very very very hard.

  think very clearly what i meant

  and how entier thing can be done effortlessly

  after that, lets start implelenting it.

  bro it must be super supser cute, and super smooth, and super awesome. 
  also the db migration files you created, shoudl be very systematic. 

  lets start.
